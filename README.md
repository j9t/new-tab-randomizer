# New Tab Randomizer

Source of the wonderful [**Chrome extension**][1]: opens a random URL every time a new tab is opened, for extra <del>security</del> <ins>obscurity</ins>.

Inspired by [chrome-random-newtab][2]. Including [randomrandom][3]. Possibly not the only extension of its kind.

Description to be extended.
