# New Tab Traffic Randomizer

Source of the wonderful [**Chrome extension**][1] which requests a random URL every time a new tab is opened, for extra <del>privacy</del> <ins>obscurity</ins>.

Important notes: Random means random, so theoretically itâ€™s possible that you end up on a bizarre page. Use the extension at your own risk. Check out the source code, notably the [list of requested URLs][2], to tell whether this is something for you (and to help make the extension better).

Hat tip to [chrome-random-newtab][3]. Featuring [randomrandom][4]. Possibly not the only extension of its kind.

Description to be extended.
